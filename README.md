Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) combined with Design Document (DD) for the optional project for Software Engineering 2 - A.Y. 2024-2025.

Professor: Matteo Camilli

Grade: 12.7/14

## Project description

The final goal of the project is the creation of the RASD and DD documents for a fictional platform called Students & Companies. The documents are created with the [IEEE 29148-2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559686) standard in mind, with a slightly modified structure to follow the course's requirements.

The complete requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/ale-polimi/soft-eng-2-Travaini/tree/main/wip/Assignment_RDD_AY_2024-2025.pdf).

The final releases of the documents can be found in [DeliveryFolder](https://github.com/ale-polimi/soft-eng-2-Travaini/tree/main/DeliveryFolder).
